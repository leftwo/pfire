# pfire and move
Some Python curses examples.

pfi takes the only argument as a file name, imports it into curses
and runs it through the fire function.

move takes the only argument as a file name, imports it into curses
and applys the move and restore methods to it.  For this program you
have to tell it "m" to make it start moving, and "r" to restore it back
to the original message.  "q" will quit.
